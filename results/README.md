# ðŸ“‚ Simulation Results

This folder contains the key results and plots generated from the coupled structuralâ€“acoustic simulations conducted during my Master's thesis.

## Contents
- **SPL Comparisons**  
  - Fully coupled vs. sequentially coupled analysis (Abaqus)
  - Structural tie elements vs. acousticâ€“structural interface elements (Abaqus)
  - FEM (Abaqus) vs. BEM (BEMPP)

- **Far-Field Visualizations**  
  - Sound pressure distribution at user-defined distances

- **Resonance Peak Analysis**  
  - Identification of dominant frequencies contributing to sound radiation

## ðŸ“Œ Note
For a detailed explanation of the results, refer to the `thesis.pdf` available in the main repository..
