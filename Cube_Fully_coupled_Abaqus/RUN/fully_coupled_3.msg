 ***WARNING: THE SYSTEM MATRIX HAS 6 NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES.

     IN A DIRECT-SOLUTION STEADY-STATE DYNAMIC ANALYSIS, NEGATIVE
     EIGENVALUES ARE EXPECTED. A STATIC ANALYSIS CAN BE USED TO VERIFY THAT THE SYSTEM IS STABLE.

     NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES MEAN THAT THE SYSTEM MATRIX IS NOT 
     POSITIVE DEFINITE:
     FOR EXAMPLE, A BIFURCATION (BUCKLING) LOAD MAY HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED.
